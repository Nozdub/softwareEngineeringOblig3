# **SoftwareEngineering Oblig 3**

## **Project Description**
  A school assignment that allowed me to run the tests we had implemented to the leapyear project every time we commit to github. 
  
  I did this by navigating into the Actions section of my repository, clicked the python application marked with testing most python 
  applications and committed. This added the workflows folder that contains the .yml file that gives github actions the directions of 
  what to do each time the project is commited to.
  
  By clicking into Github Actions tab and into each commit I can see that it goes through every step, including collecting the 4 tests 
  that I had written and passes these 100%.
